            <h1> We Are The Global Warming Saviors</h1>
            <p>An open-access journal publishing high quality, editorially selected and peer reviewed advances in the Earth, environmental and planetary sciences</p>

        <p>
            Communications Earth & Environment is an open access journal from Nature Portfolio that publishes high-quality research, reviews and commentary in the Earth, environmental and planetary sciences.
            <br>
             The papers we publish represent significant advances that bring new insight to a specialized area of research. We also provide a community forum for issues of importance to Earth, environmental and planetary scientists, regardless of sub-discipline.
             <br>

Our scope covers all areas of the geosciences, climate and environmental sciences as well as planetary sciences, including those at the interface with ecology, sustainability and environmental social sciences.
<br>
 Primary research of interest to the journal includes important insights gained from field work, novel analyses of existing data, numerical or analytical modelling, theoretical studies or laboratory experiments.
<br>
We encourage submissions that provide independent confirmation of particularly influential publications.

The submission and review processes are managed by our in-house professional editors supported by our Editorial Board Members, who provide technical expertise across the breadth of the Earth, environmental and planetary sciences. We are committed to rapid dissemination of important research results. Articles are published on a continuous basis to ensure swift communication of findings.
 <h1>Criteria for publication</h1>   
 Climate Change Research publishes scientific research and analysis on climate change and the interactions of climate change with society. The journal encompasses scientific basis, economic, social, and policy research, including mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

 The journal attempts to promote the research in climate change and to give great impetus to applications of research achievements in many aspects such as socioeconomic sustainable development, making response to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change, the diplomatic negotiations of climate and environment policies, the protection and exploitation of natural resources; and to make complex, policy-related analysis of climate change issues accessible to a wide policy audience.    
    <h1>Human impacts</h1>
    Humans are agents in climate change. Humans are affected by climate change: shifting shorelines, declining agricultural productivity, crisis of food supply, availability of water, the health of populations, and extreme weather events. These impacts will be felt differentially in developed and developing worlds. Marginalized populations of people may not only have their lives and livelihoods affected, but also be affected by declines in species abundance and diversity of ecosystems upon which they are dependent at a landscape level. In heterogeneous landscapes with a mix of wilderness islands within a changing agricultural environment, urbanization, and industrial spread could well increase pressures on protected area networks as the effects of climatic changes increase. Agricultural communities, especially traditional farmers and pastoralists, may be forced to shift into what is now within the protected area networks in developing countries. In considering human impacts we must consider unique contexts, both for effects and responses. How are certain communities bearing the burden of climate change? In what ways are attributing responsibility and to whom for the current reality? How do we measure responses on in the context of local, national, and global human life?
    <h1>Framing Responses</h1>
    On the experience of the past one hundred thousand years, humans are clearly capable of adaptive responses. Our species has the capacity or can develop the capacity to nurture nature though a period of transition, for instance by creating corridors to assist species adaptation and inventing new agricultures which alleviate and mitigate the effects of climate change. Humans are also capable of precautionary action, reducing greenhouse gases for instance as part of a broader strategy of sustainable development. We may even be able to master technologies which balance and stabilize climate change. The key, however, will be the extent to which our species can take a proactive role, be that technological or acts of social and political will that produce changed patterns of land and energy use. Like no other creature in natural history, and like no other time in this creature’s history, this is moment when the future of the planet is in our hands. The consciousness which made us a unique species perhaps a hundred thousand years ago, for the first time today puts us in a position of unprecedented responsibility for the course of natural history. Climate change is a key intellectual and practical challenge for today’s science, economics, politics, sociology, and ethics.
