      Global warming is the current rise in temperature of the air and oceans.It is happening mainly 
      <br>
      because humans burn coal, oil, and natural gas; and cut down forests.
      <br>
      temperatures today are about 1 °C (1.8 °F) higher than before people started burning a lot of coal around 1750.
      <br>
      In some parts of the world it is less and some more. Most climate scientists say that by the year 2100
      <br>
      temperatures will be 2 °C (3.6 °F) to 4 °C 
      (7.2 °F) higher than they were before 1750.</p>

        Global warming is a significant and rapidly accelerating issue caused by human activities
        such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and the burning of fossil fuels. 
        <br>
        It is having a profound impact on the environment and our planet. 
        <br>
        The present global warming is mostly because of people burning things, like gasoline for cars and natural gas to keep houses warm.
        <br>
         But the heat from the burning itself only makes the world a tiny bit warmer: it is the carbon dioxide from the burning which is the biggest part of the problem.
         <br>
          Among greenhouse gases, the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the main cause of global warming.
          <br>
           Svante Arrhenius predicted this more than a hundred years ago. Arrhenius confirmed the work of Joseph Fourier 200 years ago.

        As the Earth's surface temperature becomes hotter the sea level rises. This is partly because water over 4 °C (39 °F) expands when it gets warmer.[7] It is also partly because warm temperatures make glaciers and ice caps melt. The sea level rise causes coastal areas to flood.[8] Weather patterns, including where and how much rain or snow there is, are changing. Deserts will probably get bigger. Colder areas will warm up faster than warm areas. Strong storms may become more likely and farming may not make as much food. These changes will not be the same everywhere
